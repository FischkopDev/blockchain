<h1>A little Blockchain project</h1>
<p>This project is a small blockchain. You will be able to store data and check if 
the blockchain is still valid or not. Furthermore you have useful tools for administration
and further development. E.g. Saving the blockchain in a file, creating blocks, hashing,...<br>
Now I'm gonna show you how to work with this project: For now just include this project to your 
work. Below I have some examples of how this blockchain can be used.<br><br>
</p>

<h3>Setup and general information</h3>
<p>In my code you will find a file called Example.java. This complete project isn't that big right now, so
its an example with about 20-30 lines of code.</p>
